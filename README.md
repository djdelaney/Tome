# Tome
A Goodreads client for Windows 8

![TomeLogo](/Assets/Promo.png?raw=true)

# Purpose
This app was written to familiarize myself with C#, WPF, and the Windows 8 store app model. It was released as a free app on the Windows store, and had a few thousand users at one point. I eventually decided to work on other projects, and since the Windows store had such little traction I took the app down. 

This was written while I was learning C#, so the code quality is somewhat lacking.
